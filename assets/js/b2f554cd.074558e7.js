These seed URLs are the starting points from which the crawler begins exploring the web. \\r\\nThey can be manually provided or generated programmatically. The crawler then extracts the links present on the web page of the seed URLs and adds them to a queue for further processing.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f Crawling</b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nThe crawling stage involves visiting the URLs in the queue and retrieving the corresponding web pages. \\r\\nThe crawler sends HTTP requests to the web servers hosting the pages and receives HTTP responses in return. \\r\\nThe responses typically include HTML content, but they can also include other types of files such as images, CSS files, or JavaScript files. The crawler parses the HTML content to extract links and other relevant information for subsequent crawling.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>\u26cf\ufe0f Fetching</b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nDuring the fetching stage, the crawler retrieves the content of the web pages by downloading them from the web servers. \\r\\nThis process involves downloading the HTML and any associated files, such as images or scripts, required to render the page correctly. \\r\\nThe fetched content is then stored for further processing.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udcbb Rendering</b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nRendering refers to the process of processing and executing JavaScript code present on web pages. Some web pages heavily rely on JavaScript to load and display content dynamically. \\r\\nModern web crawlers often include a rendering engine that can execute JavaScript code, allowing the crawler to handle pages that rely on client-side rendering.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udcd1 Indexing</b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nOnce the web pages are fetched and rendered, the crawler can extract the desired data from the pages. This data can include text content, metadata, links, or any other relevant information. \\r\\nThe extracted data is typically processed and stored in an organized manner, such as in a database or an index, for further analysis or retrieval.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\nIt\u2019s important to note that web crawling is an iterative process. \\r\\nAs the crawler discovers new links during the crawling stage, it adds them to the queue for subsequent crawling, continuing the process of discovery, crawling, fetching, rendering, and indexing for a broader coverage of the web.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting Started with Web Crawling\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Identify Your Data Needs**: Determine the specific information you want to extract from websites. \\r\\nIt could be product details, contact information, news articles, or any other relevant data.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Choose a Web Crawling Tool**: There are various web crawling frameworks and libraries available, such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy in Python. \\r\\nSelect a tool that aligns with your programming language and project requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\n> _You can learn more about Python Scrapy [**here**](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)_\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Understand the Website Structure**: Familiarize yourself with the target website\u2019s structure.

Let\'s explore the realm of blockchain together. This blog focuses on the basics of blockchain technology along with its applications. In this evolving era, it is important to understand this technology because, according to  recent research, blockchain has the potential to reshape the future and the way we perceive it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Blockchain](BlockChain.jpg) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Blockchain technology* |\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n# *What is Blockchain* ?  \\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nDistributed database and immutable ledger used for recording transactions, tracking assets  and building trust is termed as blockchain.<br/>\\r\\nLet\u2019s take an example:<br/>\\r\\nImagine a blockchain as a super secure digital notebook for businesses. This notebook stores information in a special way. Instead of writing everything in one long list, it divides the information into blocks and connects them like a chain.\\r\\nWhat\'s cool about this digital notebook is that once something is written in it, you can\'t erase it or change it without everyone in the network agreeing. It\'s like having a magical pen that only writes the truth.\\r\\nSo, businesses use blockchain to keep an unchangeable record of things like orders, payments, and accounts. It\'s like a super reliable ledger that makes sure nobody sneaks in fake or unauthorized entries. Everybody in the network sees the same information, so there\'s no confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n## *What does blocks of Blockchain consist of* ?\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nBlocks are the place or container which stores all information of user like transaction data being one of many examples and once the data is stored in blocks it cannot be altered again.\\r\\n- Data : It is gives information about the user.\\r\\n- [**Hash**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-hash-function/): A hash is a mathematical function that turns any kind of information into a secret code with a specific length. It\'s like a machine that takes in any size of data and spits out a code that\'s always the same size\\r\\n- Hash of previous block : Every consequent blocks are connected with the hash of previous block. So if any one alters the one block the whole chain will get disrupted and with this it is easy to track where the data alteration is performed.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Blocks of Blockchain](Blocks-of-blockchain.png) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Blocks of Blockchain* |\\r\\n\\r\\n## *Different types of Blockchain Technology* \\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>Public Blockchain </b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nHere anyone and everyone can participate in the core activities of the blockchain network. In this network system problems like centralization, less security, and less transparency don\u2019t exist as it uses Distributed Ledger Technology( which means data is distributed across the network) . The very first example of this is Bitcoin. It enables everyone to perform transactions. Other examples of this include Litcoin and Ethereum. Use cases of public networks are in Document Validation and cryptocurrency.\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>Private Blockchain </b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nA private blockchain is like a special club for a group of people or organizations. In this club, only those who are invited can join and participate. It\'s not open to the public, like the internet. Just like a public network it also stores data in a decentralised manner. As they are limited in their size, the transaction takes place very fast.\\r\\n\\"You can think of private blockchains as being the intranet, while the public blockchains are more like the internet,\\" Godefroy said.\\r\\nUse cases of this are supply chain, internal voting, and asset ownership.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>Hybrid Blockchain </b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\nIn simpler words, a hybrid network is a combination of both private and public networks. Companies like real estate which want to keep some of their data private and need to show some information to the public like listings, use this type of network. According to Godfroy medical records can also be stored on this blockchain network where users can access their data without any third-party interruption.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>Consortium Blockchain </b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n A consortium blockchain, also called a federated\\r\\nblockchain, combines features of both private and public blockchains. It\'s like\\r\\na mix of the two. In this type of blockchain, several organizations work\\r\\ntogether on a shared network, and not just one entity has control, reducing the\\r\\nrisks. It is more like a team effort instead of just one person or organization being in charge. Use cases for this network are Banking and payment.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n##  *Why Blockchain is becoming integral part of our life* ? \\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nBlockchain technology has become a buzzword in recent times. Companies, institutions, and various transactions are rapidly adopting blockchain technology. Its popularity extends beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and following are the important reasons why blockchain is gaining prominence:<br/><br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n 1) <b>Decentalization</b><br/>\\r\\nTraditionally, we relied on centralized authorities like banks and governments for our transactions and record-keeping. Additionally, the risks of data tampering and alteration were more significant than one could imagine. To address these issues, blockchain has emerged as a solution. At its core, blockchain embodies the concept of decentralization, which means data is not stored in one central location or controlled by a single organization. Instead, it enables the distribution of control and verification across a network of participants.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) <b>Smart Contracts</b><br/>\\r\\n[**Smart Contracts**](https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts#:~:text=Next%20Steps-,Smart%20contracts%20defined,intermediary\'s%20involvement%20or%20time%20loss.), residing on blockchain technology, execute automatically when predefined conditions are satisfied, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as banks or attorneys. Parties encode contract terms, ensuring immediate execution upon meeting conditions, reducing costs, and optimizing efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) <b> Transparency and Security</b><br/>\\r\\nBlockchain technology provides a transparent system where all activities are visible to the public. Since blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger, all transactions on the internet are accessible to all network participants. Blockchain achieves transparency through the use of encryption methods for secure and unchangeable record-keeping. Blockchain security results from a combination of distributed consensus and cryptographic techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) <b>Intellectual Property (IP)</b><br/>\\r\\nIntellectual property (IP) in blockchain involves ownership of digital assets, patents for blockchain innovations, smart contracts for IP agreements, and open-source licensing. Few methods with which blockchain technology make use of IP is: Patent, Copyrights,Trademarks and Trade secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\n##  *Applications of Blockchain*  \\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we cannot imagine our lives without the internet. It has become an integral part of our daily routines. Almost everything we do happens through the internet, and in some ways, we are highly dependent on it. Due to the sudden rise in the popularity of blockchain in the previous decade, it is estimated that, like the internet, blockchain will also become an integral part of our lives. It\'s applicatiion ranges from transaction, healthcare, cryptocurrency, [**bitcoin**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-bitcoin/), IoT and what not. The part of the tech industry that deals with online data and services is about to go through a big and important change because of blockchain technology.\\r\\n<br/><br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Applications of Blockchain](Blockchain-Applications.webp) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Applications of Blockchain* |\\r\\n\\r\\n## *Let us have a look at some drawbacks of Blockchain technology*\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n- The implementation cost of blockchain is very high. For a small company, it becomes difficult to shift to blockchain technology because they need to hire a skilled blockchain developer, and in addition to this, infrastructure costs will also be incurred, which require a significant amount of funding.\\r\\n- The continuous operation of mining, minting, and transaction validation demands powerful systems that run non-stop. Beyond substantial investments, these activities consume significant amounts of energy, resulting in potentially severe environmental repercussions.\\r\\nTo address the negative environmental impact, China has taken the step of banning blockchain mining in the Inner Mongolia region.\\r\\n- In the context of blockchain networks like Bitcoin, a 51% attack occurs when a single entity or group of entities controls more than 50% of the network\'s mining or computational power. This level of control can potentially allow them to manipulate transactions and disrupt the normal functioning of the network.\\r\\n\\r\\n## *Conclusion*\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, blockchain\'s decentralization, smart contracts, and transparency offer transformative solutions across industries. Despite high implementation costs and environmental concerns, its impact is undeniable. Just as the internet integrated into daily life, blockchain is poised to shape the future of transactions and data management, promising an exciting path in technology and business."},{"id":"linux-basics","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/linux-basics","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-06-linux-cli/index.mdx","title":"Basics of GNU/Linux","description":"In this blog, you will understand the basic concept of the linux kernel and it\'s ecosystem in system softwares.","date":"2023-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"linux","permalink":"/blog/tags/linux"},{"label":"cli","permalink":"/blog/tags/cli"},{"label":"terminal","permalink":"/blog/tags/terminal"},{"label":"tui","permalink":"/blog/tags/tui"}],"readingTime":13.635,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurang Vishwakarma","title":"Creator of TCET Open Source","url":"https://github.com/demonkillerr","imageURL":"https://github.com/demonkillerr.png","key":"gaurang"},{"name":"Saasha Gupta","title":"Docs Team Member","url":"https://github.com/saashaspace","imageURL":"https://github.com/saashaspace.png","key":"saasha"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"linux-basics","title":"Basics of GNU/Linux","authors":["gaurang","saasha"],"tags":["linux","cli","terminal","tui"],"description":"In this blog, you will understand the basic concept of the linux kernel and it\'s ecosystem in system softwares.","keywords":["linux","cli","terminal","tui","opensource"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Blockchain - Future of Tommorow","permalink":"/blog/intro-to-blockchain"},"nextItem":{"title":"General Posting Guidelines","permalink":"/blog/blog-posting-guidelines"}},"content":"Linux is an operating system kernel. It was originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal use, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system, which was written to be a free (libre) replacement for Unix. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo, what even is GNU/Linux? What is free software? You must have so many more questions! Through this blog, we will try to understand what is linux, and why it is the most popular operating system in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## The world of operating systems\\r\\nMost modern opearting systems can be grouped into two categories:\\r\\n- Microsoft NT descendants like Windows XP to Windows 11, Xbox OS, Windows Phone\\r\\n- Unix based (Mostly everything apart from Windows)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why UNIX based?\\r\\nWell, the answer is simple. Most of unix-based operating systems are free to use or modify, and hence are widely adopted. UNIX itself has died today, however, it\'s clones and descendants are still alive. Some of these operating systems are direct clones of the UNIX source code, while some such as Linux are UNIX-like. Errr.. so unix-based, unix-like, what are all these?\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\'t worry, I will cover this in the next section. What\'s important in this section is you understand the fact almost everything that is not based on Microsoft NT is a direct or indirect descendant of UNIX. Some examples of operating systems that are descendants of UNIX are:\\r\\n1. Linux and it\'s derivative distributions\\r\\n2. Mac OS X\\r\\n3. BSD \\r\\n4. ChromeOS \\r\\n5. Android\\r\\n6. PS4 OS\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is this important? Because all of these operating systems here share a plethora of common core functionailty. To put it simply, most of their internals and most of their functions are same, if not, similar. For example, all of these operating systems have the same basic commands.\\r\\n\\r\\n## History of operating systems\\r\\nSince most of the operating systems today can trace their lineage to UNIX, it is important to atleast have a brief idea of what UNIX is, even though the original versions of UNIX no longer survive. Understanding the history will also help you understand why UNIX-based commands do not work on something like Windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is UNIX?\\r\\nUNIX was an operating system, developed at Bell labs in mid 1960s. Many of their innovations and design choices of the original UNIX team have lived up to 60+ years, well into the 2020s. These design choices include the idea of a multiuser operating system and a hierarchical filesystem.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNIX truely is the grandfather of all modern operating systems. All of these features that were built into different versions of the original UNIX operating system still exist in operating systems like Mac OS, Android, linux distributions and basically every thing that can trace their lineage back to UNIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Microsoft operating systems cannot trace back their lineage to UNIX, all UNIX features do not work on windows. The commands that you can run colloquially on both MacOS and Linux, do not exist natively on Windows. Windows has it\'s own commands, and it\'s own way of doing things.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](history.png)\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"><b>FIG 1:</b> UNIX\'s descendants</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Closed Source, Mixed Source, and Open Source\\r\\nIn the diagram in the above section, you can see a legend in the top right that annotates the color codes given in the diagram. These are:\\r\\n- <b>Closed Source</b> (denoted by Red): These were descendants of UNIX that were further developed by companies like Sun Microsystem, HP, etc. The source code of these developements of UNIX were strictly guarded. The code itself was kept a secret from the public and the clients did not have the permission to change or alter the source code in anyway. Each company had their own non-permissive license.\\r\\n- <b>Mixed Source</b> (denoted by Yellow): These were the descendants of UNIX that were further developed by colleges like Univesity of California, Berkeley, and many others. Berkeley was influential as they had released a mixed source code license (also known as BSD license), that would allow sharing and modification of the source code, with other colleges and companies, for educational or other purposes. \\r\\n- <b>Open Source</b> (denoted by Green): These were descendants of UNIX whose developement was done in public as their source code was made freely available for everyone to view, modify, and use. The license that governed open source software were early versions of the GNU public license(GPL). The GPL from the early days has been a really permissive license as it allowed inspection and modification of the source code as per requirement.\\r\\n\\r\\nLicensing was the key differentiator in all of these descendants of UNIX, as they governed what could be done with the operating system. Companies have to make a profit, and colleges have to follow certain rules, hence we can understand why the first two cases wanted to safeguard their code behind non-permissive licenses. But why did the third case not want to protect their code?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is, as mentioned in the above two scenarios, software was a commodity that had to be purchased. The closed source versions were to be bought by clients. (Just like you buy a windows license). These were expensive to do so and also there were limited innovations in the software, like only in the company who built it or the college where it was developed. Hence, the Free Software Foundation was formed in the late 80s to solve this issue, and that is why they had created the GPL.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Free Software Foundation (FSF)\\r\\nThe free software foundation was built as a part of the free software movement in response to proprietary and restricted software. Free is not equal to free in terms of money. Free as FREEDOM. That was FSF\'s motto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement\'s philosophy is that computers and software should not prevent cooperation between users, and instead should have the goal of liberating everyone in the cyberspace. This will encourage innovation in software. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the movement\'s leader <b>Richard Stallman</b>:\\r\\n> Users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a visionary statement as open source software allowed ground-breaking innovations in the software industry and today, most of the software we use, have some kind of free software in them, either completly or in parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What is GNU/Linux?\\r\\nRichard Stallman was the leader of a group of developers who wanted to create an open source version of the UNIX operating systems. Remember, most of the UNIX descendants like System V or BSD were closed source or mixed source? The open source operating system needed to have everything that normally came with UNIX. The components had to be FREE, as stated in the previous section.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, they began working on the GNU project (GNU stands for GNU\'s not UNIX). Creating an operating systems however is a daunting task, even for the most experienced developers. Luckily for him, at the same time, a student in the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds was working on his operating system kernel, called Linux. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn any operating system, the <b>kernel</b> is the most important and critical component. The kernel facilitates the interaction of the the hardware and other system software. At that time, while most parts of the GNU project were complete (including gcc -  compiler, open source implementations of all unix-commands, etc), the project lacked a kernel. Linus Torvalds combined his Linux kernel with the rest of the components of the GNU ecosystem, to create a full operating system. This was known as <b>GNU/Linux</b>.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](kernel.png)\\r\\n<p align=\\"center\\"><b>FIG 2:</b> Kernel in operating system</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Linux is an operating system kernel that along with other system software components creates an complete operating system called as linux distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Difference between unix-based vs unix-like\\r\\nIn FIG 1, you can see that many of the closed and mixed source operating systems are directly linked to the original UNIX. This is because the companies and colleges that wanted to develop their own versions of UNIX paid a royalty to Bell Labs to acquire UNIX. This might sound contradictary to their own non-permissive licenses. However Bell labs decided that they did not want to be in the operating systems buisness, and instead wanted to focus on telecommunication and phone buisness. Hence they happily sold off their versions of UNIX. Since these companies directly got their versions of UNIX from Bell labs, their descendant operating systems were called <b>unix-like</b>. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a bit of legal reasons too that I will not cover in the blog as it is out of scope for our discussion, but to put it in simple terms, there was a foundation formed by a few of these companies called <b>The Open Group</b>, and they defined the UNIX standard according to their developements of UNIX. In FIG 1, you can see that most of the operating systems do not have a direct connection to UNIX. This is because even though they are based on the original UNIX and are compatible with the UNIX standards, they have not been certified by The Open Group. This is often due to financial considerations, as open source projects do not have a definite source of income. Hence these operating systems are called <b>Unix-like</b>. It is basically a matter of certification by The Open Group, simply put.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Linux Distributions\\r\\nYou know that Linux is actually an operating system kernel and not an entire operating system in itself. When people talk about a linux based operating system, they are actually referring to Linux Distributions (often shorten to linux distro). Normally, a Linux Distribution bundles the linux kernel, a bunch of GNU tools, a shell, a package manager, a windowing system, and a window manager or desktop enviroment at the very least. On top of that, a linux distribution often can include utility software such as web browsers, a file explorer, a text editor, etc.\\r\\nDid you know that Linux is actually an operating system kernel and not an entire operating system in itself? When people talk about a linux based operating system, they are actually referring to Linux Distributions.

On top of that, a linux distribution often can include utility software such as web browsers, a file explorer, a text editor, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Types of Linux Distributions\\r\\nWhile there are hundreds of linux distributions, most of them are based on a few original ones. These are:\\r\\n- Arch Linux\\r\\n- Debian Linux\\r\\n- Red Hat Linux\\r\\n- Slackware\\r\\n- Gentoo\\r\\n- NixOS\\r\\n- Void Linux\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key difference between these distributions are usually their package managers. However, different distributions may choose to ship different types of components. Let\'s look at them in brief:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Distribution | Package Manager | init system | \\r\\n| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |\\r\\n| Arch Linux   | pacman          | systemd     |\\r\\n| Debian       | apt or dpkg     | systemd     |\\r\\n| Red Hat      | dnf or yum      | systemd     |\\r\\n| Slackware    | slackpkg        | bsd-style   |\\r\\n| Gentoo       | portage         | openrc      |\\r\\n| NixOS        | nix             | systemd     |\\r\\n| Void Linux   | xbps            | runit       |\\r\\n\\r\\nThese distributions are often called parent distributions as many other distributions are derived from them. Derivatives retain the package manager of the parent distributions while shipping different components. For example - a different shell, a different filesystem, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Well known derivative distributions\\r\\n- <b>Arch based</b>: Manjaro, EndeavourOS, Garuda Linux\\r\\n- <b>Debian based</b>: Ubuntu, Linux Mint, ElementaryOS\\r\\n- <b>Red Hat Based</b>: Fedora, CentOS, RockyLinux\\r\\n- <b>Gentoo based:</b> RedstarOS, Funtoo\\r\\n\\r\\n### Core Components of a distribution\\r\\nAs we have discussed, a linux distro comes with the linux kernel, a shell, a filesystem, a bunch of GNU tools, and other system software. Let us discuss in brief what each of these components do, and how they help the operating system function.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Kernel\\r\\nThe kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer\'s operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Init System\\r\\nInit system (short of for <i>initialization</i>), is the first process started during booting of the operating system. Init is a daemon process that continues running until the system is shut down. It is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes and automatically adopts all orphaned processes. Init is started by the kernel during the booting process. The process ID of init system is <b>PID 1</b>. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe init system with the help of the kernel initialises all hardware on the computer. The init scripts are launched by the init process to guarantee basic functionality on system start and shutdown. This includes (un)mounting of file systems and launching of daemons (background services).\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Filesystem\\r\\nA file system or filesystem controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, information placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the information is easily isolated and identified. Taking its name from the way paper-based information systems are named, each group of data is called a \\"file\\". The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of information and their names is called a \\"file system\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n#### The shell\\r\\nFrom Wikipedia: \\r\\n>A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter or shell that provides a traditional user interface for the Unix operating system and for Unix-like systems. Users direct the operation of the computer by entering commands as text for a command line interpreter to execute or by creating text scripts of one or more such commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shell is a computer interface to an operating system. It exposes the operating systems\' services (init system for example) to human users. The shell takes our commands, and gives them to the operating system to perform. It is called a shell because it is an outer protective layer around the operating system.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### GNU tools\\r\\nThese are important tools that are present in some or other form since the UNIX days. The GNU toolchain is a broad collection of programming tools produced by the GNU Project. These tools form a toolchain (a suite of tools used in a serial manner) used for developing software applications and operating systems. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Package manager\\r\\nFrom Wikipedia:\\r\\n> A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer in a consistent manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nA package manager deals with packages, distributions of software and data in archive files. Packages contain metadata, such as the software\'s name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum (preferably a cryptographic hash function), and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. They work closely with software repositories, binary repository managers, and app stores. \\r\\n\\r\\n#### Desktop Enviroment \\r\\nA desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets. Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated applications and utilities. Most importantly, desktop environments provide their own window manager, which can however usually be replaced with another compatible one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe user is free to configure their GUI environment in any number of ways. Desktop environments simply provide a complete and convenient means of accomplishing this task.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s Next?\\r\\nAfter reading this blog, you must have gotten the basic understanding of what GNU/Linux is, what linux itself is, and what a linux distribution is, and what it does. Moving on from here, you can dive deep and understand in depth how each component decsribed in the blog post work. For example, how does a typical linux file system look like. The world of operating systems is vast, and only so much can be covered in one blog post. \\r\\nKeep asking questions, and keep reading!"},{"id":"blog-posting-guidelines","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blog-posting-guidelines","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-01-blog-guidlines/index.mdx","title":"General Posting Guidelines","description":"General Posting Guidelines","date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"free","permalink":"/blog/tags/free"},{"label":"open","permalink":"/blog/tags/open"},{"label":"source","permalink":"/blog/tags/source"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"}],"readingTime":4.855,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurang Vishwakarma","title":"Creator of TCET Open Source","url":"https://github.com/demonkillerr","imageURL":"https://github.com/demonkillerr.png","key":"gaurang"},{"name":"Vishal Rawat","title":"Co-creator & Chief Technical Officer of TCET Open Source","url":"https://github.com/vish-rt","imageURL":"https://github.com/vish-rt.png","key":"vishal"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"blog-posting-guidelines","title":"General Posting Guidelines","authors":["gaurang","vishal"],"tags":["free","open","source","software"],"description":"General Posting Guidelines","keywords":["free","open","source","software"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Basics of GNU/Linux","permalink":"/blog/linux-basics"},"nextItem":{"title":"Exploring the Future of Gaming- Cloud Gaming Unveiled","permalink":"/blog/Cloud-gaming"}},"content":"## Welcome to our first blog\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcome everyone to TCET Open Source\'s Blog Section. Here, we promote blogging in the student community. Talk about ongoing trends in tech, student life at TCET, and any topic you feel would feel great for this blog.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\n\\r\\nThis particular blog will have recurring adjustments. Last revised on Oct 1st, 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## General Blog Guidlines\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we define all the basic guidlines a blog should follow in TCET Open Source Blogs.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Clone the project\\r\\n\\r\\nFor being able to contribute anywhere, one must be able to clone and run projects. You can visit this [tutorial](https://opensource.tcetmumbai.in/docs/projects/docs-site/getting-started) to learn how to work on this project.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Basic GitHub commands\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any contributor it is very necessary to understand basic GitHub commands to begin with. There is a _resources forum_ on **TCET - Open Source Discord server** where you can find relevant references for the same. There can also be a blog post regarding these commands in the future!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Understand file structure\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce you have cloned the project in your local storage, you will need to perform the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Open the project directory and navigate to `blog/`.\\r\\n2. Create a folder for your blog post.\\r\\n* The folder should have the following name format:\\r\\n```sh\\r\\nyyyy-mm-dd-blog-title\\r\\n```\\r\\n* Here, the date stands for the date when the post is supposed to be released. The blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\r\\n3. Within the folder, create `index.mdx`. This file will serve as a text document where you can format your content which will reflect in the final post.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Understand markdown files and syntax\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. The `index.mdx` file created in your blog folder is a markdown file, similar to how _index.html_ can be an HTML file. It is very essential for a blog contributor to understand the basic syntax of markdown. _Resource forum_ in our **[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/r7ZhAREg2M)** covers basic syntax of these files.\\r\\n\\r\\n### First steps\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore moving any further, a blogger must know the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n> - `slug` - It is the last part of the URL address that serves as a unique identifier of the blog post.\\r\\n> - `title` - The main title of the blog post. Note that the blog title should be relevant to the content within the post.\\r\\n> - `authors` - The list of authors who have worked on the blog post. Look below to understand how to add authors.\\r\\n> - `tags` - It highlights the key words of the post to boost it\'s visibility on the internet and improve the SEO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese four information are necessary to be present in every post. Without these, no posts will be approved and merged within the blog.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info Mention Authors\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthors can be added in two ways.\\r\\n- Internally in `index.mdx` (recommended, for outside organization contributors)\\r\\n- In the `authors.yml` file. (**TCET Open Source Members only**)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are not a member of the organization, you can simply append your author(s) in the following way:\\r\\n\\r\\n```mdx\\r\\nauthors:\\r\\n  - name: Name of Author 1\\r\\n    title: Designation, Post or About\\r\\n    url: https://github.com/author1\\r\\n    image_url: https://github.com/author1.png\\r\\n  - name: Name of Author 2\\r\\n    title: Designation, Post or About\\r\\n    url: https://github.com/author1\\r\\n    image_url: https://github.com/author2.png\\r\\n```\\r\\n#### Important things to take note of:\\r\\n- `url:` can also be an authors\' personal website or portfolio.\\r\\n- `image_url:` requires a user to have a profile pic on their Github Account. We recommend to append a Github Profile Icon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Adding images\\r\\n\\r\\nTired of good ol\' _textbook nerdy_ look on your post? Introducing: **images**. Images are a great way to keep the reader\'s attention to your posts, and now you can do that very easily:\\r\\n1. The image must be present within your blog folder. If it isn\'t, save the image in your blog folder.\\r\\n2. To add the image within your post, use the following syntax:\\r\\n```mdx\\r\\n![Alt text](image.png)\\r\\n```\\r\\n* Here, `image.png` stands for the name of the image you have in the blog directory. Markdown supports a great amount of image formats, ranging from png, jpg, svg, and even gifs.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note WONDERING\\r\\nIs gif pronounced _gif_ or _jif_? Something to ponder upon.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Utilizing truncate\\r\\n\\r\\nMany bloggers have many different ways to write their blogs. Many start off with a nice paragraph, some start off with images, and some do both! All blogging practices are welcome in the Organization. However it is important to **truncate**.\\r\\n\\r\\nTruncate is a custom breakpoint introduced in the blog to identify how much part of the blog should be visible in the feed. It cuts off the rest of the blog which can be read further by opening the blog itself. Here\'s a good example of how to use it:\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info This is a blogpost\\r\\n```mdx\\r\\nHello and welcome to my blogpost.\\r\\nToday we will be covering everything you can imagine! \\r\\nJAM Stack, Web3, ML, Data Science, my favourite food, Cybersecurity, and much more. \\r\\nSounds like a hefty lot, and it would be embarassing to flood out the entire blogs feed. \\r\\nThis might be a decent place to cut the rest of the blog out!\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s where the rest of the blog content goes\\r\\n```\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nHence in the output, only the above paragraph is visible on the feed. The rest of the blog would be visible once the viewer opens your blog.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Congratulations\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing these steps and points, you will be able to create a beautiful blog post. It\'s final structure would look something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Alt text](structure.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n_With a fresh blog post ready, you can now finally create a pull request to reflect your post on our blog here!_\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward to new content from you all. Have fun and go contribute something great!"},{"id":"Cloud-gaming","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/Cloud-gaming","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-1-cloudgaming/index.md","title":"Exploring the Future of Gaming- Cloud Gaming Unveiled","description":"Hey there, fellow gamers!

Today, we\'re diving into the fascinating world of **cloud gaming**, a technology that\'s changing the way we play and enjoy our favorite titles. In this article, we\'ll break down the concept of cloud gaming, its evolution, and its promising future.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction to Cloud Gaming\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine playing high-quality video games without the *need* for expensive gaming hardware or the hassle of *downloading and installing massive game files*. That\'s the magic of cloud gaming! It\'s like Netflix for gamers, where you can instantly access and play games over the internet without worrying about hardware requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost modern games demand a hefty amount of storage space and powerful hardware to run smoothly. Think about titles like Call of Duty\'s Warzone, which takes up over 1000GB of storage. To play these games with the best experience, you\'d need a high-end PC or gaming console. But what if there was a more affordable alternative?\\r\\n\\r\\n![Cloud Gaming Demonstration by playing Cyberpunk 2077 on mobile](image.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## How Cloud Gaming Works\\r\\n\\r\\n![Cloud Gaming flow](image2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nCloud gaming operates within the realm of cloud computing. Instead of storing game files on your local device, they\'re hosted and processed on powerful remote servers in data centers. Here\'s how it works in a nutshell:\\r\\n\\r\\n+ **Remote Servers**: Powerful servers host and run the games, eliminating the need for you to download and install them on your device.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ **Streaming Gameplay**: Similar to streaming services like Netflix, cloud gaming sends a video stream of the gameplay over the internet to your device.\\r\\n\\r\\n+ **Input Control**: Your inputs (the buttons you press and the moves you make) are sent to the server, where the game responds accordingly. This allows you to play even on low-end devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile cloud gaming offers incredible convenience, it\'s important to note that it can introduce some input lag, depending on factors like your internet connection stability and the distance between you and the server.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Cloud Gaming is one of the Best Examples to showcase the power of Cloud Computing.*\\r\\n\\r\\n## The History and Future of Cloud Gaming\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, cloud gaming faced numerous challenges, including network issues. Google\'s attempt with Google Stadia was ambitious but struggled due to connectivity problems. Other giants like Amazon and Microsoft also entered the arena with Amazon Luna and Xbox cloud gaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the future of cloud gaming looks bright, especially in countries like India. Gaming is growing rapidly, and cloud gaming provides an affordable platform for those unable to invest in high-end gaming hardware. The potential to earn rewards through gaming is also on the rise, further boosting its popularity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary challenge facing cloud gaming today is network-related issues, but providers are actively working on solutions to make it accessible to more users.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can say Cloud Gaming was just the first step for the cloud computing service to even non-tech users.\\r\\nGoogle is developing & testing Cloud Quantum computing so that one day everyone can access the Incredible power of Quantum computers without the need for a quantum rig, which might be bigger than most of our houses.\\r\\n\\r\\n![cloud quantum computing](image3.png)\\r\\n## Advantages and Drawbacks of Cloud Gaming\\r\\n\\r\\nCloud gaming offers several advantages, including:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Universal Platform**: You can play games on any device with an internet connection, from consoles to smartphones.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Cost-Efficiency**: No need for expensive hardware, as the processing is done on remote servers.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Portability**: Play on the go without worrying about installation and setup.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it\'s not without its drawbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Internet Dependency**: A stable internet connection is crucial for a smooth experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Input Lag**: Some games may suffer from input delay due to server processing.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Limited Awareness**: Many people are still unaware of cloud gaming, and few providers exist compared to traditional gaming options.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Current Status of Cloud Gaming\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral cloud gaming services are making waves in the industry:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] **Nvidia GeForce Now**: This service is known for its low system requirements, compatibility with various devices, and a free trial period.\\r\\n- [x] **XBox Game Cloud**: Known for Various game titles for free to play in the subscription of Game Pass.\\r\\n- [x] **JioGames Cloud**: Building the Cloud gaming culture & infrastructure in India at a reasonable rate.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Is Cloud Gaming Worth It?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile cloud gaming shows immense potential, it\'s still in its early stages. Input lag and connectivity issues can be frustrating, especially for competitive gamers. Traditional gaming setups remain a popular choice. However, as technology advances, cloud gaming has the potential to become the future of gaming in the coming decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, cloud gaming is a game-changer with the potential to democratize gaming by making it accessible to more players. As it evolves and overcomes its current challenges, we can expect cloud gaming to reshape the gaming landscape in the near future.\\r\\n\\r\\n## References:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [Nvidia GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)\\r\\n- [PlayStation Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now)\\r\\n- ~Google Stadia~ (closed right now)"},{"id":"tmai-june-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tmai-june-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-30-tmai-june-23/index.md","title":"This Month in AI - June 2023","description":"Latest News & Breakthroughs in the Month of Kuly 2023 in AI/ML/DS.","date":"2023-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"mind-benders","permalink":"/blog/tags/mind-benders"},{"label":"ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai"},{"label":"tmai","permalink":"/blog/tags/tmai"}],"readingTime":3.55,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kunal Agrawal","title":"President - Mind Benders | SSoC\'22","url":"https://github.com/kunalagra","image_url":"https://github.com/kunalagra.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/kunalagra.png"},{"name":"Keval Waghate","title":"Publication Head - Mind Benders","url":"https://github.com/KevalW","image_url":"https://github.com/KevalW.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/KevalW.png"},{"name":"Deexith Madas","title":"Treasurer -  Mind Benders","url":"https://github.com/MDeexith","image_url":"https://github.com/MDeexith.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/MDeexith.png"},{"name":"Ananta Pandey","title":"Jt.

APIs serve as mediators, enabling interoperability, data sharing, and communication between various software programmes. This article will provide you a thorough introduction to APIs and their importance in contemporary software development, whether you\'re a developer, a tech enthusiast, or just interested about the world of APIs._\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\nimport LaymanAPI from \\"./api-to-layman.png\\";\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure>\\r\\n  <img src={LaymanAPI} style={{border: \\"2px solid grey\\"}}/>\\r\\n  <center><figcaption>APIs to a layman</figcaption></center>\\r\\n</figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Introduction to API\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**Application Programming Interface** is referred to as API. It is a set of guidelines and protocols that specifies how various software components ought to communicate and share information. \\r\\n- **APIs** can be thought of as a contract that enables successful communication between two software entities. \\r\\n- **APIs** give programmers a standardised method of using the features of other software platforms, libraries, or systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why are APIs Important?\\r\\n\\r\\nAPIs have revolutionized the way software is developed and integrated. Here are some key reasons why APIs are important:\\r\\n\\r\\n<Tabs>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Seamless Integration\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\r\\n    <p>By allowing various software systems to interact and cooperate, APIs enable developers to take advantage of already-existing functions and resources without having to start from scratch.</p>\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Extensibility and Scalability\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\r\\n    <p>APIs give software developers a modular way to create new features, services, or data sources. As applications can be built upon existing APIs, promoting extensibility and scalability while saving time and effort.</p>\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Collaboration and Innovation\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\r\\n    <p>By offering a standardised method of sharing data and services, APIs promote collaboration between developers and organisations. As a result, innovation is accelerated since developers can use APIs to build new apps or incorporate current systems into creative solutions.</p>\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"User Experience\\" attributes={{className: styles.unique}}>\\r\\n    <p>APIs make it easier to incorporate services or data sources from outside sources into applications, which improves the overall user experience. For instance, incorporating a weather API into a travel app gives users access to real-time weather information, enhancing the utility and appeal of the service.</p>\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n</Tabs>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Types of APIs\\r\\n\\r\\nAPIs come in different types and formats, depending on the purpose and underlying technology. Here are some common types of APIs:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Web APIs:** These APIs allow web-based services and applications to communicate with one another. The majority of the time, they are built on widely used web protocols like `HTTP` and `REST` (Representational State Transfer).\\r\\n\\r\\n- **SOAP APIs:** Based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) APIs offer a standardised method for applications to communicate structured information across a network.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **JSON-RPC and XML-RPC:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML can be used as the data format for remote procedure calls when using the `JSON-RPC` or `XML-RPC APIs`. They\'re frequently employed for lightweight.\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Communication Styles:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **RESTful APIs:** REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for designing web APIs. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` to perform operations on resources. They often return data in formats like JSON or XML.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **GraphQL:** GraphQL is an alternative to RESTful APIs that provides a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval. With GraphQL, clients can specify the exact data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Real-Time APIs:** Real-time APIs use technologies like WebSockets to enable bidirectional communication between the client and the server. They are ideal for applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications or real-time collaboration tools.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Common APIs\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Social media APIs:** Websites like **[Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/)**, **[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)**, and **[Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/)** offer APIs that let programmers incorporate social media features into their applications, such as updating statuses, retrieving user profiles, or engaging with social networks.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Payment Gateway APIs:** Companies such as **[PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/)**, **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api)**, and **[Braintree](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs)** provide APIs for handling online payments, allowing developers to include secure payment processing into their apps.\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Mapping and Geolocation APIs:** Maps, geolocation data, routing, and other location-based services are all made available by mapping and geolocation APIs, which developers can use to build apps with mapping features.

Join us as we explore different aspects of Artificial Intelligence in this entire series.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting and rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform our world in countless ways. From self-driving cars to virtual personal assistants, AI has already made its way into many aspects of our daily lives, and its applications continue to expand.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial Intelligence is composed of two words **Artificial** and **Intelligence**, where Artificial defines _\u201cman-made,\u201d_ and intelligence defines _\u201cthinking power\u201d_, hence AI means _\u201ca man-made thinking power.\u201d_\\r\\n\\r\\n> Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what exactly is AI, and how did it come to be? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at the history of AI and its evolution over time.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Early Concepts of AI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of machines that could mimic human intelligence dates back centuries, with early examples including the ancient Greek myths of Talos, a giant bronze statue that could move and act on its own, and Pygmalion\u2019s statue, which was brought to life by the goddess Aphrodite.\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Figure 1 - Talos](Talos.webp) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Figure 1 \u2014 Talos by [**Adrienne Mayor**](https://technicacuriosa.com/author/amayor/)* |\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern era, the concept of AI began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In 1950, computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the \u201cTuring Test,\u201d which is still used today to measure a machine\u2019s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly AI research focused on rule-based systems, in which machines were programmed to follow a set of explicit rules to solve problems. While these systems were effective for some tasks, they were limited by their inflexibility and inability to learn from experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAI has many sub-categories like Machine Learning and Deep Learning. People usually tend to use these terms interchangeably. Let\u2019s look at these terms in brief -\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Figure 2 - Sub-categories of AI](sub-categories-of-AI.webp) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Figure 2 \u2014 By the [Author](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02) \u2014 Types of Artificial Intelligence* |\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Rise of Machine Learning\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, a new approach to AI emerged: Machine Learning. This approach involved designing algorithms that could learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions based on that data.\\r\\n\\r\\nMachine learning algorithms were initially used for simple tasks such as recognizing handwritten characters, but their applications quickly expanded to more complex problems, including speech recognition, image recognition, and natural language processing.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deep Learning and Neural Networks\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2010s, a subfield of machine learning known as deep learning began to emerge, fueled by advances in computing power and data storage. Deep learning algorithms are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, using artificial neural networks to simulate the behavior of neurons and synapses.       \\r\\n\\r\\nDeep learning has enabled breakthroughs in areas such as image and speech recognition and has led to the development of autonomous vehicles and other advanced technologies.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Future of AI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs AI continues to advance, its potential applications are virtually limitless. From personalized healthcare to smart homes and cities, AI has the power to revolutionize nearly every aspect of our lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Uncle Ben says, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d AI systems become more sophisticated, it\u2019s important to ensure that they are designed and deployed ethically and responsibly, with consideration for issues such as bias, privacy, and security.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Types of Artificial Intelligence\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Figure 3 - Types of AI](types-of-AI.webp) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Figure 3 \u2014 By the [Author](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02) \u2014 Types of Artificial Intelligence* |\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Type 1: Based on Capabilities\\r\\n\\r\\n**Narrow AI**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Narrow AI is a type of AI that is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.\\r\\n*   Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.\\r\\n*   Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce sites, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.     \\r\\n\\r\\n**General AI**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   General AI is a type of intelligence that could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.\\r\\n*   The idea behind the general AI is to make such a system that could be smarter and think like a human on its own.\\r\\n*   It is currently a hypothetical concept, and we don\u2019t yet have any real-world examples of this type of AI.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Super AI**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than humans with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.\\r\\n*   Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. The development of such systems in real is still world changing task.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artificial Intelligence \u2014 Type 2: Based on Functionality\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reactive Machines**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.\\r\\n*   Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.\\r\\n*   These machines only focus on current scenarios and react to them as per the possible best action.\\r\\n*   Examples: IBM\u2019s Deep Blue system, Google\u2019s AlphaGo\\r\\n\\r\\n**Limited Memory**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.\\r\\n*   These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.\\r\\n*   Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store the recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, \\r\\nthe speed limit, and other information to navigate the road.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Theory Of Mind**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Theory of Mind AI should understand human emotions, people, and beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.\\r\\n*   This type of AI machine is still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvements for developing such AI machines.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Self-Awareness**\\r\\n\\r\\n*   Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and \\r\\nself-awareness.\\r\\n*   These machines will be smarter than the human mind.\\r\\n*   Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial intelligence has come a long way since the early days of rule-based systems, and its evolution shows no signs of slowing down. With ongoing research \\r\\nand development, the potential applications of AI are vast and ever-expanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you enjoy reading stories on similar topics then do [follow](https://medium.com/@nidhiworah02/subscribe) the account.

This could be useful in a range of sectors\u2014for example, metals that perform well at lower temperatures could improve spacecraft, while metals that resist corrosion could be used for boats and submarines.\\r\\nUsually they start off with one well-known element, like iron, which is cheap and malleable, and add one or two others to see the effect on the original material. It\u2019s a laborious process of trial and error that inevitably yields more duds than useful results.\\r\\nResearchers from the Max Planck Institute managed to identify 17 promising new metals using this method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Revolutionizing ML: Researchers Unveil a More Agile Approach [^7]\\r\\n\\r\\nArtificial intelligence researchers have celebrated a string of successes with neural networks, computer programs that roughly mimic how our brains are organized. In 2020, two researchers at the MIT led a team that introduced a new kind of neural network based on real-life intelligence \u2014 but not our own. After a breakthrough last year, the novel networks may now be versatile enough to supplant their traditional counterparts for certain applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquid neural networks offer an elegant and compact alternative , said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at the University of California, Berkeley. These networks can run faster and more accurately than other so-called continuous-time neural networks, which model systems that vary over time\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[^1]: [https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/22/the-new-bing-preview-experience-arrives-on-bing-and-edge-mobile-apps-introducing-bing-now-in-skype/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^2]: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ai-can-help-you-land-your-dream-job-step-by-step-hemachandran/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-ai-can-help-you-land-your-dream-job-step-by-step-hemachandran/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^3]: [https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/](https://deci.ai/blog/yolo-nas-object-detection-foundation-model/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^4]: [https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/amp/](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/amp/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^5]: [https://theconversation.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-says-ai-is-a-new-form-of-intelligence-unlike-our-own-have-we-been-getting-it-wrong-this-whole-time-204911](https://theconversation.com/ai-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-says-ai-is-a-new-form-of-intelligence-unlike-our-own-have-we-been-getting-it-wrong-this-whole-time-204911)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^6]: [https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1062104/machine-learning-new-metals](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1062104/machine-learning-new-metals)\\r\\n\\r\\n[^7]: [https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-discover-a-more-flexible-approach-to-machine-learning-20230207](https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-discover-a-more-flexible-approach-to-machine-learning-20230207)"},{"id":"rotaract-club-of-tcet","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/rotaract-club-of-tcet","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-15-rcblog/index.md","title":"Rotaract Club of TCET","description":"About Rotaract Club of TCET","date":"2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cultural","permalink":"/blog/tags/cultural"},{"label":"social","permalink":"/blog/tags/social"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"editorial","permalink":"/blog/tags/editorial"}],"readingTime":5.255,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Nikita Shukla","title":"Docs Team Lead | Ex-Chairperson HRD @RCTCET","url":"https://github.com/NikitaSShukla","imageURL":"https://github.com/NikitaSShukla.png","key":"nikita"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rotaract-club-of-tcet","title":"Rotaract Club of TCET","authors":["nikita"],"tags":["cultural","social","community","editorial"],"description":"About Rotaract Club of TCET","keywords":["cultural","social","community","editorial"]},"prevItem":{"title":"This Month in AI - April 2023","permalink":"/blog/tmai-april-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Dive into Web Design \ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f | Learn the Mental Model for converting Designs into Code","permalink":"/blog/dive-into-web-design"}},"content":">Are you one of those engineers who are just engrossed in academics and is looking to do something more than that in your college days?

You can add you own flavours to this. Skip steps which are not required. I made this using my personal experience so add modify it if I missed anything. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Write HTML, using the divisions approach\\r\\n2. Set background color\\r\\n3. Set display - flex (if any child tags)\\r\\n4. Set width - compulsory\\r\\n5. Set height - optional\\r\\n6. set overflow properties\\r\\n7. Set font \u2192 size, weight, line height, letter spacing, \\r\\n8. Set text colors \u2192 paddings \u2192 borders \u2192 margins \\r\\n    1. Colors - normal, hover, active any states\\r\\n    2. Borders - width/thickness , color, radius, style\\r\\n9. Set position (if want to move the element from its position)\\r\\n    1. relative - move it from its current position\\r\\n    2. absolute - move it from its **first relative parent** start point (top-0, left-0 of relative parent)\\r\\n    3. fixed - move it from windows start point (top-0, left-0 of whole window)\\r\\n10. Set z-index - define stack, which element should be above which\\r\\n11.

Whether you are just starting out with web development or are looking to enhance your existing skills, I hope that you will find valuable insights and tips within these pages.\\r\\nSo sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and join me on our journey through the exciting world of ReactJS!\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs](reactjs.png) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *\u201cDesign is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.\u201d \u2014 Steve Jobs* |\\r\\n\\r\\n<br/>\\r\\n\\r\\n# What is React JS?\\r\\n\\r\\nReact JS is nothing but a java script library that helps the developers in creating reusable UI components there by increasing the efficiency of code. When making dynamic websites React JS is proven to be more effective than Vanilla JS, and hence it has become a popular choice for building fast and scalable single-page applications. In simple terms, ReactJS helps make web development more efficient, organized, and dynamic.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Characteristic Features of React JS that makes it more versatile and Popular\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Features of ReactJS](characteristics.png) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Features of ReactJS* |\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. Virtual DOM\\r\\n\\r\\nIn traditional web development, when changes are made to a web page, the entire page needs to be re-rendered, which can be slow and time-consuming. The Virtual DOM solves this issue by creating a virtual representation of the web page in memory so when changes are made, ReactJS updates the virtual DOM instead of the actual page, which is much faster. Then, ReactJS compares the virtual DOM to the actual page and updates only the parts that have changed, rather than the entire page. This makes the updates and rendering process much faster and more efficient, improving the overall user experience of the web application.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Reusable Components\\r\\n\\r\\nReactJS uses a component-based architecture, which means that the user interface is built using reusable components. Each component is a self-contained unit that handles a specific task or displays a specific piece of information, we can say that each components are independent. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain, as well as reducing the amount of redundant code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Community\\r\\n\\r\\nReact has a vast and supportive community of developers who are constantly contributing new features and tools. React is open-source, meaning that anyone can contribute to the development of the library by fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving existing ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n>[*Link to contribute to the React Library*](https://github.com/facebook/react)\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4. JSX\\r\\n\\r\\nJSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript used by ReactJS that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript. This makes it easier for users to write and understand the code, as it closely resembles the structure of HTML. This helps to improve the overall development experience by making the code more intuitive and easier to read.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, instead of writing the following code in pure JavaScript to render a simple button:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js \\r\\nReact.createElement(\\"button\\", {className: \\"myButton\\"}, \\"Click Me!\\");\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same code can be written in JSX as:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<button className=\\"myButton\\">Click Me!</button>; \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## 5. Server-side Rendering\\r\\n\\r\\nServer-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the browser. In the case of React, this means that the React components can be rendered on the server, allowing the browser to receive a fully rendered HTML page, instead of having to wait for JavaScript to execute and render the page on the client side again and again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis results in faster initial load times, as the browser doesn\u2019t have to wait for the JavaScript to execute and render the page. Additionally, server-side rendering can improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO), as search engines can better index and understand the content of the page.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 6. Compatibility\\r\\n\\r\\nReact\u2019s simplicity and straightforward design makes it easy for developers to learn and adopt and it works seamlessly with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux, allowing developers to create complex and scalable web applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Comaprison with other Frontend Frameworks\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Popular Web Frameworks](chart1.png) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Comparison with other frameworks as per the recent survey* |\\r\\n\\r\\n>Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the above survey it can be clearly seen that React JS was named as one on the most commonly used web Framework.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact\u2019s virtual DOM provides fast updates and rendering compared to traditional DOM manipulation. Angular and Vue also have optimized updates, but they may not be as fast as React\u2019s virtual DOM.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, React is known for its simplicity and minimalistic approach, making it relatively easy to learn and get started with. Angular, on the other hand, has a steeper learning curve due to its more complex architecture. Vue falls somewhere in between, offering a more accessible learning experience as compared to Angular.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see more detailed insights of React JS on their [**Official Website**](https://reactjs.org/)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, React is the future of web development, offering a robust set of features and tools that make it easy to build high-performing, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Its simplicity, performance, and compatibility with other technologies make it an excellent choice for modern web development."},{"id":"intro-to-cloud-computing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intro-to-cloud-computing","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-09-intro-to-cloud-computing/index.md","title":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","description":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","date":"2023-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 9, 2023","tags":[{"label":"cloud computing","permalink":"/blog/tags/cloud-computing"},{"label":"data","permalink":"/blog/tags/data"},{"label":"source","permalink":"/blog/tags/source"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/blog/tags/software"}],"readingTime":5.505,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Agarwal","title":"CEO @ TCET Open Source | 2x Kaggle Expert | Software Developer | Data Analyst","url":"https://github.com/himanshu-03","imageURL":"https://github.com/himanshu-03.png","key":"himanshu"},{"name":"Mahima Churi","title":"COO @ TCET Open Source | Full Stack Web Developer","url":"https://github.com/Mahitej28","imageURL":"https://github.com/Mahitej28.png","key":"mahima"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intro-to-cloud-computing","title":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","authors":["himanshu","mahima"],"tags":["cloud computing","data","source","software"],"description":"Cloud Computing: Revolutionizing the Way We Store and\xa0Access\xa0Data","keywords":["cloud computing","data","source","software"]},"prevItem":{"title":"6 Reasons Why React JS is the Future of Web Development!!","permalink":"/blog/intro-to-react-js"},"nextItem":{"title":"Breaking The Ice - Open Source","permalink":"/blog/breaking-the-ice-open-source"}},"content":"> This Blog talks about the emerging trends in Cloud computing, and also gives a gist about the term Cloud Computing and its impact in leveraging businesses and individuals.

From understanding the meaning of cloud computing model to discussing various characteristics, this blog will be your one-stop-shop for all things cloud computing. So, fasten your seatbelts and let\'s dive into the exciting world of the cloud together!!\\r\\n\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n# What is Cloud Computing ?  \\r\\n\\r\\nCloud computing is a way of using current technology where we can access and use internet-based services and storage to manage, process, and store data and information, instead of having to have it all on your own personal device or computer. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can think of it like having access to a giant computer in the sky that we can use to do our work, store our files, and run our applications, without having to worry about the technical details or maintenance of the underlying hardware and software. This makes it easier and more convenient for us to access our data and resources from anywhere in the world, as long as we have an internet connection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Let\'s take a look at some intriguing features of Cloud Computing!!\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary><b>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f On-Demand Self-Service</b></summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\r\\nWith cloud computing, we can provision computing services, like server time and network storage, automatically. No communication with the service provider will be necessary. Customers of cloud services can view their cloud services, track their usage, and provision and de-provision services by logging into their cloud accounts through a web self-service portal.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>\\r\\n<b>\ud83d\udcbb Broad Network Access</b>\\r\\n</summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\r\\nBroad network connectivity is another crucial aspect of cloud computing. Through a network and on portable devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs, we can access cloud services. A private cloud employs a local area network, whereas a public cloud uses the internet. Broad network access and cloud computing both rely heavily on latency and bandwidth since they have an impact on service quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>\\r\\n<b>\ud83d\udcdd Resource Pooling</b>\\r\\n</summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\r\\nWith resource pooling, multiple customers can share physical resources using a multi-tenant model. Based on demand, this model distributes and redistributes real and virtual resources. Customers can share the same applications or infrastructure with multi-tenancy while still retaining their privacy and security. Customers may be able to designate the location of their resources at a higher level of abstraction, such as a country, state, or data centre, even though they won\'t know the precise location of their resources. Customers can pool a variety of resources, including memory, computing power, and bandwidth.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>\\r\\n<b>\ud83d\udd17 Rapid Elasticity</b>\\r\\n</summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\r\\nCloud services can be elastically provisioned and released, sometimes automatically, so customers can scale quickly based on demand, thus making it highly scalable. The capabilities available for provisioning are practically unlimited. Customers can use these features whenever they want and in whatever amount. Customers can scale cloud capacity, cost, and usage without incurring additional contracts or charges. We won\'t need to acquire computer hardware thanks to quick elasticity. \\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>\\r\\n<b>\u2699\ufe0f Measured Service</b>\\r\\n</summary>\\r\\n<div>\\r\\n\\r\\nA metering capability in cloud systems optimises resource utilisation at an abstraction level appropriate for the type of service. For storage, processing, bandwidth, and users, for instance, we can utilise a metered service. A pay-for-what-you-use model is used to base payments on the customer\'s actual consumption. Consumers and service providers benefit from a transparent experience that is created by monitoring, managing, and reporting resource use.\\r\\n\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Lets have a look at some of the most used Cloud Storage Services\\r\\n<br />\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Most Used Cloud Storage Services](most-used-cloud-storage-services.png) |\\r\\n| :--: |\\r\\n| *Most used Cloud Storage Services* |\\r\\n\\r\\nGoogle Drive is by far the most popular cloud storage service in the world, with an use rate of **94.44 percent**.

There is a project management technique for everything. Well, almost everything. I haven\'t found a project managing concept to overcome my feelings of procrastination. Someone might create it one day.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What really _is_ Open Source?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you\'re the engineering type of person that tackles humanity\'s problems and urgent needs by bringing together an entire community and building a \\"project\\" with them, you\'ll want to know about **Open source**. Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation. \\r\\n\\r\\nHere it is again in bigger letters, for impact:\\r\\n\\r\\n> ### Open source refers to a philosophy of software development that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now you know what open source is. _In theory, this blog post could be done!_\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Beyond the marketing standpoint\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology is a concept which is ever-changing in how it is defined, its magnitude and how we as engineers develop it. In the world of technology we always find \\"buzz words\\" which reflect the recent advancements which are so efficient that they are slowly brought within the industry as a standard way of working on projects, as a team.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne such \\"buzz word\\" in the area of software development and project management is open source. Open source is a way of working on a software typically developed in a public, collaborative manner, with the source code made freely available to anyone who wants to use, modify, or distribute it. The term \\"open source\\" was coined in 1998 by a group of people in the software industry who wanted to create a new model of software development that was more collaborative and community-driven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen source software is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers and contributors, who work together to improve the software and fix bugs. Consider your **homework**: a dry document which contains things here and there which you know is very incomplete. If you have a good enough personality _(which I don\'t)_, you send this document to all your classmates who start doing bits of your homework.\\r\\n\\r\\n_The result?_ A fine specimen of a document which the entire class can show to your teachers for great marks! What you just did here was open sourcing your homework and let your student community work on it to create a more appealing document which is now complete.\\r\\n\\r\\n### But open source doesn\'t stop there\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine your homework to be your project, your classmates to be your community. This community observes your project and suggests various improvements within it. Be it suggesting simple changes of changing the fonts or re-working the already existing complex APIs and queries.\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Example of suggestions](meme.jpg) |\\r\\n|:--:|\\r\\n| *A simple conversation between a contributor and a project developer* |\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother way to look at open source can be building the big **Lego City** together, block by block. Everyone can add their own pieces to what has been constructed so far and everyone can see how the city is made. In this way, everyone can make the city better and use it how they want.\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Software Engineers](budding.jpg) |\\r\\n|:--:|\\r\\n| *Budding software engineers collaborating to build their project* |\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen source is a great way to bring like-minded developers together. Everybody around you, be a fresher student or an industry experienced individual, has had to encounter with open source technologies without even realizing it. From something we daily use like **Android** to **Linux**: the operating system used by many corporates and tech giants, there\'s no saying what the next big thing will be.\\r\\n\\r\\n| ![Open Source](open.jpg) |\\r\\n|:--:|\\r\\n| *Python, Dart, React, MongoDB, even this text box is open source* |\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\'s about the gist of what I wished to express regarding open source. Surely that\'s not everything but I do look forward to go in-depth into this topic and talk about various different things which excite me! Do look forward to upcoming blogposts and reach me out for any constructive criticism, if any, for the future blogposts."}]}')}}]);
